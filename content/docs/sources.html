title: Source Management Conventions

In order to be available in Scibian packages repositories, all source packages
must be maintained into Git repositories hosted in the GitHub [Scibian
organization](https://github.com/scibian).

All source packages Git repositories are maintained using the
[`git-buildpackage`](https://honk.sigxcpu.org/piki/projects/git-buildpackage/)
utility.

# Branches

As an extension of
[`git-buildpackage` default conventions](https://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.intro.html#gbp.repository),
the branches of the source packages Git repositories must respect the following
naming conventions, depending on the package type.

## Scibian specific native packages

* `master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

## Debian native packages modified in Scibian

* `master`: last imported version of the code and packaging from Debian.
* `debian/$codename` *(optional)*: code and packaging for specific Debian
  releases (ex: `debian/stretch`).
* `scibian/master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

## Scibian specific quilt package

* `upstream` : last imported version of the code as released by upstream
  developers.
* `scibian/master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

**NOTE:** There is no `master` branch in this context. The default branch in
GitHub repository settings must be set to `scibian/master`.

## Debian quilt package modified in Scibian

* `upstream`: last imported version of the code as released by upstream
  developers.
* `master`: last imported version of the code and packaging from Debian.
* `debian/$codename` *(optional)*: code and packaging for specific Debian
  releases (ex: `debian/stretch`).
* `scibian/master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

All `debian/*` et `scibian/*` branches of the Git repositories must be buildable
using [pbuilder](https://pbuilder.alioth.debian.org/) (or similar). Otherwise,
it must considered as a bug.

# Tags

As an extension of `git-buildpackage` default conventions, the tags of the
source packages releases in the Git repositories must respect the following
naming conventions:

* `upstream/$version`: for upstream release (ex: `upstream/1.2.3`)
* `debian/$version`: for Debian releases (ex: `debian/1.2.3-1`)
* `scibian/$version`: for Scibian releases (ex: `scibian/1.2.3-1`)

For native packages, there is no `upstream/*` tags.

To create the Scibian releases tag using `git-buildpackage`, run the following
command:

```
gbp buildpackage --git-tag-only \
                 --git-debian-tag='scibian/%(version)s' \
                 --git-debian-tag-msg='%(pkg)s Scibian release %(version)s'
```
