# Build Infrastructure

![Scibian build infrastructure]({{ media_url('images/scibian_build_infrastructure.svg') }})

Scibian systems use a combination of Debian and Scibian package repositories.
Debian repositories are maintained by the [Debian project](http://debian.org)
community. The Scibian packages repositories only contains additional packages
or modified packages from the Debian community for the needs of scientific
computing.

The sources of the Scibian packages are maintained in Git repositories hosted
in the GitHub Scibian organization. When commits are pushed to these Git
repositories, webhooks trigger packages build on a Jenkins instance setup with
jenkins-debian-glue plugin. If packages builds are successful, Scibian package
repositories are updated with new packages.

The Scibian team members push commits directly to the Git repositories of the
GitHub Scibian organization. Other contributors are invited to fork these
repositories are send pull requests. Please [contact us](/about.html#contact)
to become a member of the Scibian team!

# Source packages repositories

In order to be available in Scibian packages repositories, all source packages
must be maintained into Git repositories hosted in the GitHub [Scibian
organization](https://github.com/scibian).

All source packages Git repositories are maintained using the
[`git-buildpackage`](https://honk.sigxcpu.org/piki/projects/git-buildpackage/)
utility.

## Branches

As an extension of
[`git-buildpackage` default conventions](https://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.intro.html#gbp.repository),
the branches of the source packages Git repositories must respect the following
naming conventions, depending on the package type.

### Scibian specific native packages

* `master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

### Debian native packages modified in Scibian

* `master`: last imported version of the code and packaging from Debian.
* `debian/$codename` *(optional)*: code and packaging for specific Debian
  releases (ex: `debian/stretch`).
* `scibian/master: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

### Scibian specific quilt package

* `upstream` : last imported version of the code as released by upstream
  developers.
* `scibian/master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

**NOTE:** There is no `master` branch in this context. The default branch in
GitHub repository settings must be set to `scibian/master`.

### Debian quilt package modified in Scibian

* `upstream`: last imported version of the code as released by upstream
  developers.
* `master`: last imported version of the code and packaging from Debian.
* `debian/$codename` *(optional)*: code and packaging for specific Debian
  releases (ex: `debian/stretch`).
* `scibian/master`: code and packaging for last Scibian release.
* `scibian/$release` *(optional)*: code and packaging for previous Scibian
  releases (ex: `scibian/8`).

All `debian/*` et `scibian/*` branches of the Git repositories must be buildable
using [pbuilder](https://pbuilder.alioth.debian.org/) (or similar). Otherwise,
it must considered as a bug.

## Tags

As an extension of `git-buildpackage` default conventions, the tags of the
source packages releases in the Git repositories must respect the following
naming conventions:

* `upstream/$version`: for upstream release (ex: `upstream/1.2.3`)
* `debian/$version`: for Debian releases (ex: `debian/1.2.3-1`)
* `scibian/$version`: for Scibian releases (ex: `scibian/1.2.3-1`)

For native packages, there is no `upstream/*` tags.

# Packages metadata

## Names

Scibian specific native packages must be prefixed with `scibian-`. This rule
applies to both source and binary packages.

This rule does not apply to software temporarily released as native package in
Scibian only (for the sake of quick delivering in this distribution) if they
can be usefull outside the scope of the distribution (ex:
[unclebench](https://github.com/edf-hpc/unclebench)). In the long term, the goal
must be to package this software as an upstream code.

## Versions

The Scibian version numbering policy is a direct extension of Debian policy:
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#version. This document notably
explains what are the following version components:

* `epoch`
* `upstream_version`
* `debian_revision`

This sections explains all the extensions to this policy with examples for most
cases. Scibian introduces the following version components:

* `scibian_version`: the version number of the Scibian major release, it must
  match `\d{1,2}` (ex: `9`).
* `scibian_release`: the release number for the package in the Scibian release,
  it must match `\d+` (ex: `12`).

### Scibian specific native package

```
[epoch:]<upstream_version>
```

Examples:

* `10`
* `1.2.3`

### Debian native packages modified in Scibian

```
[epoch:]<upstream_version>sci<scibian_version>u<scibian_revision>
```

Examples:

* `1.2.3` released in Debian → `1.2.3sci9u1` for the 1<sup>st</sup> release in
  Scibian 9
* `1.2.3` released in Debian → `1.2.3sci8u3` for the 3<sup>rd</sup> release in
  Scibian 8

### Quilt packages

```
[epoch:]<upstream_version>-<debian_revision>sci<scibian_version>u<scibian_revision>
```

*NB:* the `debian_version` must be set to `0` if the package is not imported from
Debian but created from scratch for Scibian.

Examples:

* `1.2.3` released upstream and not released in Debian → `1.2.3-0sci9u1` for
  the 1<sup>st</sup> release in Scibian 9
* `1.2.3-1` released in Debian → `1.2.3-1sci9u1` for the 1<sup>st</sup> release
  in Scibian 9
* `1.2.3-1~bpo9` released in Debian stretch backports → `1.2.3-1~bpo9sci9u1` for
  the 1<sup>st</sup> release in Scibian 9

## Changelogs

When an issue reported in a bug tracker is fixed, a changelog entry must mention
this closed issue.

For example: `Added patch X (closes: GH-Y).`

Where `Y` is the number of the issue in GitHub.

## Sections

The section of Scibian specific native packages must be `scibian`.

## Maintainers

The maintainers in `debian/control` file of all Scibian packages must be set
to: Scibian Project &lt;packaging@scibian.org&gt;

## Copyrights

In the source code files headers of Scibian specific native packages and in
`debian/copyright` file of the Scibian specific source packages, the copyright
must be given to: Scibian Project &lt;legal@scibian.org&gt;

This rule does not apply to source code files headers of software temporarily
released as native package in Scibian only if they can be usefull outside the
scope of the distribution (ex:
[unclebench](https://github.com/edf-hpc/unclebench)). For this software, the
real upstream developer or team must be used for copyrights.

## Tools identity

Maintainance tools which requires an identity (for automatic commits or
changelog updates) must use: Scibian Project &lt;packaging@scibian.org&gt;

## Licensing

All code produced in Scibian project must be licensed under the terms of
[GPLv3 free software license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
Exceptions to this rule must be wise.

## Internationalization

All technical texts not aimed to end users (code comments, commit messages,
changelogs, and so on) must be written in english.

The Scibian specific software command-line interfaces (CLI) must be in english.
They do not have to provide internationalization.

The Scibian specific software graphical user interface (GUI) must provide
internationalization (based on gettext system) with english as default language and
at least french as an additional language.
