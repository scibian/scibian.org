Scibian systems use a combination of Debian and Scibian package repositories.
Debian repositories are maintained by the [Debian project](http://debian.org)
community. The Scibian packages repositories only contains additional packages
or modified packages from the Debian community for the needs of scientific
computing.

The sources of the Scibian packages are maintained in Git repositories hosted
in the GitHub Scibian organization. When commits are pushed to these Git
repositories, webhooks trigger packages build on a Jenkins instance setup with
jenkins-debian-glue plugin. If packages builds are successful, Scibian package
repositories are updated with new packages.

The Scibian team members push commits directly to the Git repositories of the
GitHub Scibian organization. Other contributors are invited to fork these
repositories are send pull requests. Please [contact us](/about.html#contact)
to become a member of the Scibian team!

Find out the [technical documentation](/docs/infra_tech.html) about this build
infrastructure for administration purposes.
