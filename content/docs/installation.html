This documents describes how to install Scibian Linux on a single desktop machine.

# Manual installation

The manual installation process consists in first installing a regular Debian system and then adding Scibian packages over it.

## Debian Jessie installation

Download an official Debian Jessie install media from <https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/latest-oldstable/amd64/iso-cd/> for the amd64 architecture.

Install a minimal system: when asked for which software you wish to install, uncheck everything except "standard system utilities" and "SSH server" if you need it.

If you need any assitance with Debian installation, you can refer to the official installation manual: <https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/amd64/>

## Scibian installation

Boot you newly installed Debian system and login as `root`.

Create the folders `/local00` and `/scratch` with permissions 755.

Add the contrib and non-free sections to the Debian APT sources:
```
sed -i 's/ main/ main contrib non-free/' /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Add the Scibian reposity to APT sources:

```
cat >> /etc/apt/sources.list << EOF
deb http://scibian.org/repo/ scibian8 main
EOF
```

Trust the Scibian archive GPG signing key by issuing this command:

```
wget https://scibian.org/repo/scibian-auto-keyring.pub -O- | apt-key add -
```

Make sure Scibian versions of packages have priority over Debian versions.

```
cat >> /etc/apt/preferences.d/00scibian << EOF
Package: *
Pin: release o=Scibian
Pin-Priority: 1001
EOF
```

Update the package lists:

```
apt-get update
```

You are now ready to install Scibian packages over your existing Debian installation:

```
apt-get install scibian-desktop
```

or if you wish to include non-free components:

```
apt-get install scibian-desktop-non-free
```

This step might take a long time to install all the packages and might in some cases downgrade some packages.

Once `scibian-desktop` is installed, reboot the machine to take into account the new kernel.

You're now ready to use Scibian !

# Automatic installation

Scibian provides autmatic installation media.

Documentation for automated installations is coming soon.
