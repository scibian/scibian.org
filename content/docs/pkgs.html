# Names

Scibian specific native packages must be prefixed with `scibian-`. This rule
applies to both source and binary packages.

This rule does not apply to software temporarily released as native package in
Scibian only (for the sake of quick delivering in this distribution) if they
can be usefull outside the scope of the distribution (ex:
[unclebench](https://github.com/edf-hpc/unclebench)). In the long term, the goal
must be to package this software as an upstream code.

# Versions

The Scibian version numbering policy is a direct extension of Debian policy:
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#version. This document notably
explains what are the following version components:

* `epoch`
* `upstream_version`
* `debian_revision`

This sections explains all the extensions to this policy with examples for most
cases. Scibian introduces the following version components:

* `scibian_version`: the version number of the Scibian major release, it must
  match `\d{1,2}` (ex: `9`).
* `scibian_release`: the release number for the package in the Scibian release,
  it must match `\d+` (ex: `12`).

## Scibian specific native package

```
[epoch:]<upstream_version>
```

Examples:

* `10`
* `1.2.3`

## Debian native packages modified in Scibian

```
[epoch:]<upstream_version>sci<scibian_version>u<scibian_revision>
```

Examples:

* `1.2.3` released in Debian → `1.2.3sci9u1` for the 1<sup>st</sup> release in
  Scibian 9
* `1.2.3` released in Debian → `1.2.3sci8u3` for the 3<sup>rd</sup> release in
  Scibian 8

## Quilt packages

```
[epoch:]<upstream_version>-<debian_revision>sci<scibian_version>u<scibian_revision>
```

!!! note
    The `debian_version` must be set to `0` if the package is not imported from
    Debian but created from scratch for Scibian.

Examples:

* `1.2.3` released upstream and not released in Debian → `1.2.3-0sci9u1` for
  the 1<sup>st</sup> release in Scibian 9
* `1.2.3-1` released in Debian → `1.2.3-1sci9u1` for the 1<sup>st</sup> release
  in Scibian 9
* `1.2.3-1~bpo9` released in Debian stretch backports → `1.2.3-1~bpo9sci9u1` for
  the 1<sup>st</sup> release in Scibian 9

# Changelogs

When an issue reported in a bug tracker is fixed, a changelog entry must mention
this closed issue.

For example: `Added patch X (closes: GH-Y).`

Where `Y` is the number of the issue in GitHub.

# Sections

The section of Scibian specific native packages must be `scibian`.

# Maintainers

The maintainers in `debian/control` file of all Scibian packages must be set
to: Scibian Project &lt;packaging@scibian.org&gt;

# VCS URL

The `Vcs-Browser` and `Vcs-Git` metadata must be set with an URL to a Git
repository in the GitHub Scibian organization.

# Copyrights

In the source code files headers of Scibian specific native packages and in
`debian/copyright` file of the Scibian specific source packages, the copyright
must be given to: Scibian Project &lt;legal@scibian.org&gt;

This rule does not apply to source code files headers of software temporarily
released as native package in Scibian only if they can be usefull outside the
scope of the distribution (ex:
[unclebench](https://github.com/edf-hpc/unclebench)). For this software, the
real upstream developer or team must be used for copyrights.

# Tools identity

Maintainance tools which requires an identity (for automatic commits or
changelog updates) must use: Scibian Project &lt;packaging@scibian.org&gt;
